# literate-eureka
First Repo to get to grips with github and run test etc


this will be filled of very random and very unoganised files, but this is kist when i have a uick idea to test out, i will open the code editor, throw it down and then commit to the repo, 


### test

so just tested creating a branch to edit the code, i will then practive a merge request to see how that works
